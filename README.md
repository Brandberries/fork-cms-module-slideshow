	<li>All galleries have a publishing time and date</li>
	<li>You can upload multiple images at once</li>
	<li>Publish, delete or hide individual images</li>
	<li>Set several options for slideshows like animation type, animation time, slideshow speed and navigation type. While you can set these settings for <b>all</b> slideshows (via module settings), you can also define <b>individual</b> settings for every slideshow separately. </li>
</ul>

## Notes

When creating a gallery, you'll be asked to give a width and height. You can fill in both or only the width. If you choose the latter, images will scale proportionally based upon the width. Give in both width and height, and images will be cropped to the desired dimensions.
